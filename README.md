# LEAP Program — Sprint 5 Lab Exercises

This repository main branch contains the hands-on lab exercises accompanying **Sprint 5: Software
Engineering Essentials, Java & OOAD**, Sprint 5 of the LEAP graduate programme.

Additional Sprints will be pushed to a new branch.  For example Sprint6 will be in branch sprint6

## Prerequisites

- Java 21 (JDK) and Maven
- An IDE with UML support helpful but not required (diagrams are drafted by hand/whiteboard
  first, then captured — see Module 4 onward)
- GitHub Copilot Chat (continuing as a learning aid — Module 9 specifically has you critically
  assess a GenAI-suggested refactor rather than accept it outright)

## Coming from Sprint 4

This sprint moves from Python back to Java (last used in Sprint 1/2). Module 1 is explicitly
framed as a Python-to-Java translation guide, not a from-scratch introduction — if a Java concept
feels unfamiliar, look for its Python equivalent first, most core ideas (types, collections,
exceptions, control flow) transfer directly, only the syntax and the compiler's strictness change.

## Structure

Each module has its own folder under `demos/`, `labs/`, and `solutions/`. Java modules are
self-contained Maven projects (`pom.xml` in each), runnable independently:

- `demos/<module>/` — instructor-led demo assets and guides
- `labs/<module>/` — your starter files and the task README for that module
- `solutions/<module>/` — reference solutions (try the lab first!)

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` into a module's `labs/<module>/` folder and run `mvn test` to confirm your environment
   works before starting.
3. Work through the modules in order, starting with `labs/01-core-java-refresher/README.md`.

## Support

Ask your trainer or Scrum team lead during class, or raise a question in the cohort's usual
support channel.

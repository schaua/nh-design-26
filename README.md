# LEAP Program — Sprint 6 Lab Exercises

This repository contains the hands-on lab exercises accompanying **Sprint 6: Software
Architecture & Enterprise Java**, sprint 6 of the LEAP graduate programme.

## Prerequisites

- Java 21 (JDK) and Maven
- Docker (for Modules 12-13)
- Postgres (the Sprint 3 enterprise schema — see `shared/`)
- Node.js (for the auth stub used in Modules 9 and 13)
- GitHub Copilot Chat (continuing as a learning aid — Module 9 specifically has you critically
  interpret a GenAI-suggested explanation of an unfamiliar security stack trace, not accept it
  outright)

## Coming from Sprint 5

This sprint takes the Order Processing & Settlement Engine you built in Sprint 5 and turns it
into a real, deployable microservice. The core domain logic — `OrderValidator`, `HoldingUpdater`,
the `Instrument`/`Feeable` hierarchy — doesn't change; it gets wrapped in a Spring Boot service,
persisted to Postgres, secured with JWT, and containerised. See `shared/mission-brief.md`.

## Structure

Each module has its own folder under `demos/`, `labs/`, and `solutions/`. Java modules are
self-contained Maven projects (`pom.xml` in each), runnable independently:

- `demos/<module>/` — instructor-led demo assets and guides
- `labs/<module>/` — your starter files and the task README for that module
- `solutions/<module>/` — reference solutions (try the lab first!)

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` into a module's `labs/<module>/` folder and check that module's README for setup.
3. Work through the modules in order, starting with
   `labs/01-microservices-and-the-mission-service/README.md`.

## Support

Ask your trainer or Scrum team lead during class, or raise a question in the cohort's usual
support channel.
